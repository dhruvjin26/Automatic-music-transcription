This project implements an automatic music transcription system that converts audio files into MIDI format by extracting musical notes using machine learning techniques. The system focuses on achieving high accuracy for polyphonic music and optimizing data preprocessing workflows for faster audio processing.

Features
High Accuracy: Achieves over 90% accuracy for polyphonic music transcription.
Deep Learning Architectures: Explores and evaluates various model architectures such as:
CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)
CCNN (Conditional Convolutional Neural Network)
CRNN_Conditioning
Optimized Preprocessing: Reduces audio processing time by 30% through optimized feature extraction workflows.
End-to-End System: Automatically converts audio input to MIDI files.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch
Data Preprocessing: NumPy, Librosa
MIDI Processing: pretty_midi, mido
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-to-tones.git
cd music-to-tones
Set up a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place the audio files in the input_audio/ directory.
Run the transcription script:
bash
Copy code
python transcribe.py --input input_audio/yourfile.wav --output output_midi/
The transcribed MIDI file will be saved in the output_midi/ directory.

Key Implementation Steps
Audio Preprocessing:

Convert audio files into spectrograms and other relevant features.
Use Librosa for efficient feature extraction.
Model Training:

Train CRNN, CCNN, and CRNN_Conditioning models on annotated datasets.
Employ techniques like data augmentation and dropout for improved performance.
Transcription Pipeline:

Extract features from input audio.
Predict note sequences using the trained model.
Convert predicted notes into MIDI format using pretty_midi.
Results
Accuracy: Over 90% for polyphonic music transcription.
Efficiency: Processing time reduced by 30% compared to baseline workflows.
Future Work
