This project implements an automatic music transcription system that converts audio files into MIDI format by extracting musical notes using machine learning techniques. The system focuses on achieving high accuracy for polyphonic music and optimizing data preprocessing workflows for faster audio processing.
Features
•	High Accuracy: Achieves over 90% accuracy for polyphonic music transcription.
•	Deep Learning Architectures: Explores and evaluates various model architectures such as:
o	CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)
o	CCNN (Conditional Convolutional Neural Network)
o	CRNN_Conditioning
•	Optimized Preprocessing: Reduces audio processing time by 30% through optimized feature extraction workflows.
•	End-to-End System: Automatically converts audio input to MIDI files.
